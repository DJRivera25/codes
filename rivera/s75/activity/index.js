/* 

Problem: Find the Maximum of Two Numbers  
Problem Statement: Write a function that takes two numbers as input and returns the maximum of the two.

*/

// 1. Core Task
// What is the main action or result the problem is asking for?
// Example: Determine and return the larger of two given numbers.


// 2. Input
// What data or values are provided to the program?
// How many inputs are required?
// Example: Two numeric inputs — num1 and num2.


// 3. Output
// What result or value should the program return or display?
// What type of output is expected?
// Example: A single number — the greater of num1 and num2.


// 4. Constraints
// What limitations should the program follow? 
// Are there any specific boundaries on input size or type?
// Are there time or space complexity constraints?
// Example: 
// - Both inputs must be valid numbers (integers or floats).
// - If the numbers are equal, return either one.
// - Time complexity should be O(1), since it's a direct comparison.


// 5. Steps to Solve
// What are the main actions that the program must perform?
// Can the problem be broken down into smaller, sequential steps?
// Example Steps:
// a. [Step 1] - Receive two number arguments (e.g., num1 and num2).
// b. [Step 2] - Use a conditional statement to compare num1 and num2.
// c. [Step 3] - If num1 is greater, return num1.
// d. [Step 4] - Otherwise, return num2 (which includes the case where num1 == num2).

/* 

// Problem: Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
// Problem Statement: Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

*/

// 1. Core Task
// What is the main action or result the problem is asking for?
// Example: Calculate and return the area of a rectangle using the formula: area = length × width.


// 2. Input
// What data or values are provided to the program?
// How many inputs are required?
// Example: Two numeric inputs are required:
// - length (a number representing the length of the rectangle)
// - width (a number representing the width of the rectangle)


// 3. Output
// What result or value should the program return or display?
// What type of output is expected?
// Example: A single numeric value representing the calculated area of the rectangle.


// 4. Constraints
// What limitations should the program follow? 
// Are there any specific boundaries on input size or type?
// Are there time or space complexity constraints?
// Example:
// - Inputs must be valid non-negative numbers (length ≥ 0, width ≥ 0).
// - No special time or space complexity issues, since the operation is O(1).
// - Area must be returned as a number.


// 5. Steps to Solve
// What are the main actions that the program must perform?
// Can the problem be broken down into smaller, sequential steps?
// Example Steps:
// a. [Step 1] - Receive two inputs: length and width.
// b. [Step 2] - Multiply length by width to get the area.
// c. [Step 3] - Return or display the area.
