Nickname: DJ

Motivation:

My motivation in joining this bootcamp is to gain a skill that will help me become a part of a tech industry specially in web developing. I love problem solving, though I am a licensed civil engineer, I cant see myself pursuing the construction field for a long period of time since it requires six (6) days of work per week which affects my commitment in the church so I decided to shift into programming. 

Work Experience:

I am a Project Engineer in Urban Development Corporation (known as Urban Fit Out Construction) for 1year and 8 months. during those days, I accomplished one (1) commercial building (bikeshowroom) near munoz, Quezon city and one (1) 3-storey high-end residential in Victoria Place, Malabon. My 3rd project is in dasmarinas village, makati which is the residential house of Lucio co (puregold CEO) however due to personal reasons I decided to shift my career to programming. 

As a project Engineer, I run the site activities, including the estimates of materials, rebar cutting lists, handling of permits and material test results.
